# Python Family
Here is a small and summarized training repository of **'Python'** and technologies related to Python, like **'Django'** or even **'pip commands'**.
This source helps me do not forget what I have learned, also this help me to access important details in code syntax and commands, or repeatable codes that I do most of the time.

You can use this resource and help me to upgrade or edit it.
